"Portfolio-Website" 
Portfolio website for GA12008 Assignment 1. 

This website contains a home page, an about me page with details of my job and interests, a portfolio page with a CV and project information and a contact page with contact details and a submittable form which sends an email to my University of Dundee email address. 

The folder structure should be as follows: 
<pre>
├── index.html

├── about.html

├── portfolio.html

├── contact.html

├── css/

│ ├── style.css

├── assets/

  ├── img.jpg
  
  └── video.mp4
</pre>
The website can be viewed locally by downloading the source folder and opening a html file with a browser. This is the easiest way to view and use the website locally.
